One of the conclussions of DrupalCon Baltimore was that Drupal 8 has impressive tools to build a decoupled application. However, assembling all the tools together and setting them up correctly can be a little bit daunting. On top of that, once you have everything set up you need to figure out the ins and outs of your front-end project.

With this in mind, Contenta CMS is born to make your content happy. Contenta CMS is the response of the community to build an API-First Drupal distribution. The goals of Contenta are simple: provide a standard platform that is API ready along with demo content and example front-end applications. In summary Contenta intends to ease the pain of using, or simply trying, decoupled Drupal.

In this session you will learn how we achieve this goals, what is the roadmap of the projects and how easy it is to try decoupled Drupal using Contenta.
