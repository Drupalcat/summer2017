I'll show how to deploy to production when you only press the button merge pull request.

The tools I will explain in this session will be&#58;
- https://concourse.ci/ for build the pipeline
- https://platform.sh/ for deploying environment
- tests performance, behavior, visual regression, security or whatever you want!
- syncs & backups/snapshots
