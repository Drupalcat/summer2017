Drush make days are over. Drupal in its effort to "get off the island" has adopted a new but popular tool for dependency management in the PHP ecosystem: composer.

I will go through the basics of how to use this tool quickly and some interesting features like caching, semantic versioning, class autoloading, etc.

The I will folllow with the main ways I found to leverage composer and do more with it&#58;
- Scaffold your Drupal project (initializing)
- Apply patches from the community to Drupal core and modules
- Differentiate dependencies for development from the rest
- Get exact same version of libraries for all developers
- Download frontend libraries
- Download compiled binary tools for my machine.

And if the time allows we can open a discussion about good practices and tricks to make our composer experience better.
